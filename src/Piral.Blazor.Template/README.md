# Piral.Blazor.Template

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/badge/nuget-v7.0.6-blue)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Piral.Blazor.Template/7.0.6)

For getting started easily, a Blazor template is available. This will set up a Blazor pilet for the preferred Piral instance.

### Installation

- Make sure that [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) is installed.
- Run `dotnet new install Piral.Blazor.Template::7.0.6` to install the project template globally.

You can optionally also specify a `--npmRegistry` option. The default for this is set to `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

The Piral instance name should be the name of the Piral instance as it is published on npm.

Build the project. The first time you do this, this can take some time as it will scaffold the pilet.
